# Docker


## What is Docker?

***Docker*** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. 
- By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.


### Benefits:

- Can be started within seconds, as a Docker container is just a process running on the operating system.
- Ensures faster deployment -> With Docker, you do not have to create a new environment and only have to download the Docker image to run on a different server.
- Allows you to scale and maintain the containers efficiently -> You can run multiple containers containing isolated applications on the same host or server.
- Docker containers require fewer resources, as these are being shared by multiple containers running on the same server.
- You can install and run Docker on various platforms using Docker images, like Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Containerization vs Virtualization

Virtualization and containerization are two different technologies used to optimize and manage server resources. 
- The main difference between the two is that **virtualization** involves *creating virtual machines (VMs) that mimic the functionality of physical machines*, while **containerization** involves *creating isolated environments on a single operating system*.

### 1. Virtualization:
In virtualization, the hypervisor creates multiple virtual machines, each with its own operating system, to run different applications. 
- Each VM runs on top of the host's hardware, and the hypervisor manages the allocation of resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to the VMs. - This allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single physical server, making more efficient use of hardware resources.

### 2. Containerization:
In containerization, the container engine creates multiple containers, each running its own application, on top of a single operating system.
- Each container shares the operating system kernel, libraries, and other resources, but has its own isolated file system and network interfaces.
- This allows multiple applications to run in isolation from one another, while still using the same operating system and hardware resources, making more efficient use of the underlying infrastructure.

Overall, virtualization provides greater isolation between applications, while containerization offers greater efficiency and flexibility, especially in the context of cloud computing and microservices architectures.

## Docker architecture

![](images/docker-architecture.png)

The Docker architecture can be divided into three main components:

1. Docker daemon.
- This is the core component of the Docker architecture, which runs on the host machine and manages the containers. 
- The daemon listens for Docker API requests and performs tasks like building, running, and distributing containers.

2. Docker client. 
- The client is the command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon. 
- The client sends commands to the daemon using the Docker API, which the daemon then executes. 
- The client can be installed on the same machine as the daemon or on a remote machine that connects to the daemon over the network.

3. Docker registry. 
- The registry is a central repository that stores Docker images.
- An image is a read-only template that contains the instructions to create a Docker container. 
- The registry can be either public (such as Docker Hub) or private (such as a company's internal registry), and images can be pushed to or pulled from the registry by the Docker client.

When a user wants to create a container, they use the Docker client to issue commands to the Docker daemon, which then executes the command and creates the container. The container is created from a Docker image, which can be either downloaded from a registry or built locally using a Dockerfile.

Once the container is running, it has its own isolated file system, network interfaces, and process namespace, but shares the kernel with the host operating system. This allows multiple containers to run on a single host machine while maintaining isolation from one another. The Docker daemon manages the resources allocated to each container and can monitor their status and performance.

## Installing Docker
- First, we need to create a `Docker hub` account.
- We can do that by usingthe following link:

[Docker Hub sign up](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

- Once the account has been created, you will most likely be prompted to install `Docker desktop` for your current OS (Yes, Docker is smart like that. It recognises the OS you are running and prompts you for the download page of the software according to your OS).
- If you have not been automatically prompted to download `Docker desktop` after creating the `Docker hub` account, follow the link below:

[Docker Desktop download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- When the download finished, run the .exe file.
- You might need to restart your computer to finish the installation. 
- Once you restarted you computer (if asked to do so), Make sure that you run the `Docker desktop` as `admin`. 
- If the installation went well, open a `git bash` as `admin` and run:
```
docker

docker --version
# must be docker 20.x
```
- To test that `Docker desktop` is workin properly, run the following in the `git bash` terminal:
```
docker run hello-world

# should outputs the following message 
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

- There are also some settings we have to ensure in `Docker desktop`. So, please open `Docker desktop` and go to `Settings`. 
- Your settings should look like this:

![](images/docker-settings.PNG)

- This is to ensure that `docker` runs as soon as we boot up our machine and that is using `WSL2`. 
- When you boot up your machine, if you expect `Docker desktop` to run as soon as the system starts, you should be able to check via `Show hidden icons` arrow on your toolbar.

![](images/toolbar.PNG)

![](images/docker-running.png)
- If the icon is red, it means that `Docker desktop` is not running, so it is worth restarting the `Docker daemon(Docker desktop)`.

## Docker commands
- To find out the Docker commands, we can simply run in the CLI:
```
docker
```
- The output will look like this:

## Pulling an image from the `Docker registry` (`Docker Hub`)

### Docker main commands:
1. docker pull = pull an image from the registry.
2. docker run = pull an image from registry(if not locally available) and execute it in a conatiner. 
3. docker build = build an image from scratch.

- We will now attempt to pull an image that contains `nginx`.
- In the `Docker Hub/ Docker registry` there are thousands of images available created by contributors. It is best to check that the image you will pull has been built by a verified contributor or it is an official image.

![](images/docker-nginx.PNG)

- Now that we know that the image we need is an official image, we need to open a `git bash` terminal as `admin`.
- Once in the `git bash` terminal, run the command:
```
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

# you should receive a long id as an output which means that the image has been pulled and a container has been created where the image is running
```
- To test that a container has been created and the nginx image is running correctly inside the container, go on your browser and in the search bar type:
```
localhost
```
- In your browser, you should be now able to see the `nginx homepage`.

![](images/nginx-running.PNG)

- If you would like to check the containers that are currently running, run the following command:
```
docker ps
```

![](images/nginx-container.PNG)
- The output will show the container ID, the image that the container is running, etc.

#### !!! Please note: If you do not assign a name to the container, it will receive a random name from `docker`. E.g., in the screenshot attached, the random name assigned is "cranky_dijkstra". 

- If you want to destroy/stop the container, you can do that by running:
```
docker rm <container_id> -f 
# will force stop it and remove it even if it is running

docker stop <container_id>
# will stop the container from running
```
